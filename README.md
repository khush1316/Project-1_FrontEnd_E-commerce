# Project-1_FrontEnd_E-commerce
This is my FrontEnd Project on E-Commerce Website made with the help of HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT &amp; BOOTSTRAP

In this project(E-Commerce website) I have used html for designing, CSS and bootstrap for styling the webpage and JavaScript to make the page dynamic.
Many Bootstrap classes are being used to make the website responsive like .carousel, .nav, .container, .container-fluid, .collapse, .btn and many more which can be seen in the website’s source code.
The pages are as follows with their stylesheet and JavaScript:-
1.	Homepage (index.html, style.css, scriptind.js)- Homepage contains <header> tag and <footer> tag and in that styling is done through the style.css. The homepage also consist of the carousel card with the slider and the controlling is done through scriptind.js . The Homepage is responsive also.
2.	All Product(product.html,  styleprod.css)- All Product page also contain the <header> and <footer> tag and the styling of this page is done through styleprod.css stylesheet. In this page the product image heading and the price of the product is mentioned with the button which says “Add to cart” and all the products are arranged within the grids.
3.	Contact Us & Login (contact.html, login.html, style1.css, script.js)- Contact Us page consist of an image and a form section which says name, email, and a message under the .row and .col class. And the login page is also comprise of form with an email id and password which is checked using script.js. Both Contact us and Login page uses single stylesheet which is style2.css.
